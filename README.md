So, I'm not sure if I succeeded in making this game or not. Most of it was done using Cursor. Part of the goal was to understand better how PixiJS is used to make games. That kind of didn't work, because Cursor just did everything and then it all magically works. I feel somewhat alienated from the game because of this - even though the speed at which I managed to get it working was quite stunning.

So on the game: it's pretty simple. You're a Platipus and flying boxing gloves are trying to push you off the island. It's a rodeo game in a way, where if you manage to last 30 seconds without being pushed off of the island, you win the game. I am thinking of actually building in a title screen and some levels (more gloves, faster gloves, smaller island, those kinds of adjustments). But the game is complete though!
